==========================
Input filename: sample02.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.6
Cutadapt version: 3.4
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG' (user defined)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 17 bp
Maxiumum tolerated read length after trimming (for smallRNA trimming): 40 bp
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 4 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 4 bp from their 3' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed
