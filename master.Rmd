## Setup

Restore the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to install all of the packages as declared in the lockfile, ie. get all the software needed for this template

```{r}
renv::restore()
```

## Summarise the read counts/mapping rates for both pipelines

*This will output a csv file with various mapping/read count metrics for all samples from the smrnaseq/excerpt pipeline outputs as well as the raw fastq files (./mapping_rates/mapping_rates.csv)*

```{bash}
bash mapping_rates/extract_mapping_info.sh
```

## Sequencing read QC

*This will output an interactive html document exploring the raw sequencing read count and number of reads used for alignment (./sequencing_read_QC/sequencing_read_QC.html)*

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("./sequencing_read_QC/sequencing_read_QC.Rmd")
```

## Prepare count data

*This will output a csv file with raw, counts per million and log counts per million for all samples and RNA species (./prepare_counts/counts.csv)*

```{r}
base::source("./prepare_counts/prepare_counts.R")
```

## RNA species composition plotting

*This will output two interactive html document exploring the RNA species composition (./rna_species_composition/rna_species_composition_treatments.html and ./rna_species_composition/rna_species_composition_samples.html)*

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("./rna_species_composition/rna_species_composition_treatments.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("./rna_species_composition/rna_species_composition_samples.Rmd")
```

## MDS plots

*This will output an interactive html document exploring the multidimentional scaling (MDS) of the RNA's (./mds/mds.html) as well as csv files with raw mds data (./mds/mds_results/)*

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("./mds/mds.Rmd")
```

## PCA plots

Data prep for app

*This will output several csv files that are used in the RShiny PCA app (for example: ./pca/pca_results/individuals_1_2.csv, ./pca/pca_results/variables_1_2.csv and ./pca/pca_results/scree.csv)*

```{r}
base::source("./pca/data_prep_for_app.R")
```

Run the RShiny app locally or deploy to a shinyapps IO account (which will allow you to link the app in a github page), see the server and ui scripts that comprise the app at `./pca/server.R` and `./pca/ui.R` respectively

## Differential expression analysis

*This will output an interactive html document exploring the differential expression analysis of the RNA's (./diff_expression/diff_expression.html) as well as csv files with raw differential expression results data (./diff_expression/diff_expr_results/diff_expr_results.tsv)*

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("./diff_expression/diff_expression.Rmd")
```

## Heatmaps

*This will output an interactive html document with heatmaps (./heatmaps/heatmaps.html)*

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("./heatmaps/heatmaps.Rmd")
```

## Presence/absence

*This will output an interactive html document exploring the presence/absence of the RNA's between treatment groups (./presence_absence/presence_absence.html)*

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("./presence_absence/presence_absence.Rmd")
```

## Expression plots

Data prep for app

*This will output an sqlite database and several csv files that are used in the RShiny PCA app (for example: ./expression_plotting/expr_plotting_results/master-count.sqlite and ./expression_plotting/expr_plotting_results/master_diff_expr_data.csv). It will also output a version of the config file from ./config/config.yaml that is ready to be used by the app (./expression_plotting/expr_plotting_results/config.yaml)*

```{r}
base::source("./expression_plotting/data_prep_for_app.R")
```

Run the RShiny app locally or deploy to a shinyapps IO account (which will allow you to link the app in a github page), see the server and ui scripts that comprise the app at `./expression_plotting/server.R` and `./expression_plotting/ui.R` respectively

## Save session info

*This will record the R version and packages you're using for reproducibility purposes (./R_version_info.txt and ./R_session_info.txt)*

```{r, results = "hide"}
# save session info
base::writeLines(utils::capture.output(base::R.Version()), "R_version_info.txt")
base::writeLines(utils::capture.output(utils::sessionInfo()), "R_session_info.txt")
```
